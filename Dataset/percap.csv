Additional information on confidentiality protection, sampling error, nonsampling error, sample design, and definitions can be found on the Internet at http://www.census.gov/retail/arts/how_surveys_are_collected.html. Per capita estimates prior to 2000 are not available because the population estimates used in the calculations were not available on a comparable basis.
